Runtime Analysis:

When the input is a sorted array, the method "getCandidatePair" will be called in the main function.
It will pass the array and the target for that array. In the "getCandidatePair" method, I used two trackers
to find 2 matching pairs that when they add up they will be equal to the target. Every time the while loop
is running, only one tracker gets updated (depending on if the program haven't found a match yet), it will
then result in a program that will not scan the same numbers over and over.
So this will give us in a runtime of O(n) or less (where n = the size of the array).

When the input is unsorted, the method "getCandidatePair_unsorted" will be called in the main function.
It will then pass the array and the target for that array. In the "getCandidatePair_unsorted" method, I
implemented the HashSet to find the 2 matching pairs. In this, we only use one for-loop that will run n times
or less (depending on if the program found a match before the for-loop ends).
This method will then result in an O(n) time complexity (where n = the size of the array).
